/* There are several obvious problems with our herbivores. First, they are terribly greedy, stuffing themselves with every 
plant they see until they have wiped out the local plant life. Second, their randomized movement (recall that the view.find 
method returns a random direction when multiple directions match) causes them to stumble around ineffectively and starve if 
there donâ€™t happen to be any plants nearby. And finally, they breed very fast, which makes the cycles between abundance and 
famine quite intense.

Write a new critter type that tries to address one or more of these points and substitute it for the old PlantEater type in 
the valley world. See how it fares. Tweak it some more if necessary. */
